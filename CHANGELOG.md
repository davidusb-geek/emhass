The workflow for setting the EMHASS configuration regardless of the installation method has now been centralized on the single `config.json` file. The webserver has now a configuration tab that can be used to to modify and save the `config.json` file.

[https://github.com/davidusb-geek/emhass/pull/334](https://github.com/davidusb-geek/emhass/pull/334)

### Automatic version bot improvements

- Bump markupsafe from 2.1.5 to 3.0.2

### Fix
- Revert to myst-parser==3.0.1 to solve documentation compilation failures

## 0.10.6 - 2024-07-14

### Fix
- Fixed problem with negative PV forecast values in optimization.py, by @GeoDerp

## 0.10.1 - 2024-06-03
### Fix
- Fixed PV curtailment maximum possible value constraint
- Added PV curtailement to variable to publish to HA

## 0.10.0 - 2024-06-02
### BREAKING CHANGE
- In this new version we have added support for PV curtailment computation. While doing this the nominal PV peak power is needed. The easiest way find this information is by directly using the `inverter_model` defined in the configuration. As this is needed in the optimization to correctly compute PV curtailment, this parameter need to be properly defined for your installation. Before this chage this parameter was only needed if using the PV forecast method `scrapper`, but now it is not optional as it is directly used in the optimization. 
Use the dedicated webapp to find the correct model for your inverter, if you cannot find your exact brand/model then just pick an inverter with the same nominal power as yours: [https://emhass-pvlib-database.streamlit.app/](https://emhass-pvlib-database.streamlit.app/)
### Improvement
- Added support for hybrid inverters and PV curtailment computation
- Implemented a new `continual_publish` service that avoid the need of setting a special automation for data publish. Thanks to @GeoDerp
- Implement a deferrable load start penalty functionality. Thanks to @werdnum

## 0.2.8 - 2022-04-18
### Fix
- Fixed if sentence to correctly use the supervisor API for publish data.
- Fixing a error computing the nearest index of DataFrame. Using a try/catch strategy to use nearest method as a backup.

## 0.2.7 - 2022-04-18
### Fix
- Fixing a fatal error where the publish data function will never reach the savec csv file as the default filename is not equal to the expected filename in publish_data.

## 0.2.6 - 2022-04-16
### Improvement
- Improved handling of errors concerning solver issues with Pulp. Added support for `glpk` solver. For now just using a try/catch strategy but should update to solver passed as a parameter to EMHASS.

## 0.2.3 - 2022-03-29
### Improvement
- Improved support for the new add-on and direct communication via the supervisor.
- The CLI now can return the version using the --version argument.
- Improved comments in forecast class.
### Added
- Added unittest for csv method for weather forecast.
- Added support for passing lists of values to all forecasting methods.
### Fix
- Removed dependency from PVLib Forecast class, as it has been marked as deprecated.
- Fixed failing docs builds due to uncompatible jinja2 an markupsafe versions.

## 0.2.2 - 2022-03-05
### Added
- Added a new input data file using pickle for tests.
- Added support to select if the logger should save to a file or not.
- Added CI workflow using github actions.
### Breaking changes
- Changed package usage of configuration file path, now the user must provide the complete path including the yaml file itself.
- Changed the names of the configuration and secrets yaml files. These changes will avoid compatibility issues when using hass add-ons.

## 0.2.1 - 2021-12-22
### Fixed
- Cleaned unittest implementation
### Added
- Added support to choose the methods for weather and load forecast from configuration file.
- Added new load cost and power production price forecasts, mainly allowing the user to load a CSV file with their own forecast.

## 0.2.0 - 2021-10-14
### Fixed
- Fixed tests to pass with latest changes on passing path and logger arguments.
- Updated requirements for PVLib and Protobuf.
- Removed unnecessary use of abstract classes.
- Fixed test_optimization bad setup.
- Fixed logger integration in classes
- Updated documentation
### Added
- Implemented typing for compatibility with Python4
- Implemented different types of cost functions

## 0.1.5 - 2021-09-22
### Fixed
- Fix a recurrent previous bug when using get_loc. The correct default behavior when using get_loc is changed from backfill to ffill.

## 0.1.4 - 2021-09-18
### Fixed
- Fixed a bug when publish-data and reading the CSV file, the index was not correctly defined, so there was a bug when applying pandas get_loc.

## 0.1.3 - 2021-09-17
### Fixed
- Fixed packaging and configuration for readthedocs.

## 0.1.2 - 2021-09-17
### Fixed
- Modified the cost function equation signs for more clarity. Now the LP is fixed to maximize a profit given by the revenues from selling PV to the grind minus the energy cost of consumed energy.
- Fixed a deprecation warning from PVLib when retrieving results from the ModelChain object. Now using modelchain.results.ac.

## 0.1.1 - 2021-09-17
### Fixed
- Fixed sign error in cost function.
- Change publish_data get_loc behavior from nearest to backfill.
- Changed and updated behavior of the logger. It is constructed and integrated directly in the main function of the command_line.py file. It now writes to a log file by default.
- Fixed some typos and errors in the documentation.

## 0.1.0 - 2021-09-12
