This file documents rules for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Aider, Copilot, Codex) working on EMHASS source. It complements `docs/develop.md` (canonical for humans) and does not duplicate its content. Where `docs/develop.md` already covers a topic, this file links and adds AI-specific constraints on top.

## Repository layout

- `src/emhass/` — core module: `optimization.py`, `forecast.py`, `retrieve_hass.py`, `web_server.py`, `command_line.py`, `utils.py`.
- `tests/` — pytest suite.
- `docs/` — Sphinx source. Start with `develop.md`; worked examples in `study_cases/`.
- `data/` — config defaults and schema (`config_defaults.json`, `associations.csv`).
- `src/emhass/static/` — web UI assets, including `param_definitions.json`.

## Section 1 — Canonical commands

Setup, environment variables, and the full developer workflow live in `docs/develop.md` (Method 1 Python venv with `uv`, Method 2 DevContainer, Method 3 Docker). Read that first.

Quick-recall for AI tools:

| Action | Command |
|---|---|
| Run tests | `pytest tests/` |
| Sync dev deps | `uv sync --extra test` |
| Build docs | `sphinx-build -b html docs docs/_build` (configured in `docs/conf.py`) |
| Lint | No enforced linter at the time of writing. |

Tech stack (verify versions in `pyproject.toml` before assuming an API):

| Component | Version source |
|---|---|
| Python | `pyproject.toml` `requires-python` |
| Pydantic | v1 at the time of writing |
| Optimisation | CVXPY (pin in `pyproject.toml`) |
| Web | Flask |
| Tests | pytest |

## Section 2 — Pipeline map

EMHASS exposes three optimisation modes from `command_line.py`. All share an input-prep step and a publish step; the body differs by mode. The optimisation core is one method on the `Optimization` class.

| Phase | Symbol |
|---|---|
| Input preparation | `command_line.py::set_input_data_dict` |
| Mode entry, perfect forecast | `command_line.py::perfect_forecast_optim` |
| Mode entry, day-ahead | `command_line.py::dayahead_forecast_optim` |
| Mode entry, rolling MPC | `command_line.py::naive_mpc_optim` |
| Optimisation core (LP build and CVXPY solve) | `optimization.py::Optimization.perform_optimization` |
| Publish | `command_line.py::publish_data` |

For finer-grained stage instrumentation, the codebase uses `stage_timer(stage_times, "<label>", logger)` blocks. Five labels are in active use:

- `"pv_forecast"`
- `"load_forecast"`
- `"price_prep"`
- `"optim_solve"`
- `"publish"`

Grep `'stage_timer.*"<label>"'` for the live call site at any time. The labels are stable across refactors; the line numbers are not.

## Section 3 — Don't-touch rules

These four invariants are easy to break by accident and hard to detect in CI.

1. **`action_logs.txt` line format.** The web server's error-detection logic in `src/emhass/web_server.py` parses each line by splitting on the first whitespace and comparing the leading token to `"ERROR"`. Any change to the log line format (extra prefix, structured-logging migration, JSON envelope) silently breaks error reporting in the UI.

2. **`utils.get_logger` handler-proliferation guard.** The function checks whether a logger already has handlers before attaching new ones. Removing or bypassing that guard causes duplicated log lines under repeated module imports, which has historically masked real failures by hiding them in scroll-back.

3. **Two parallel logging subsystems.** The CLI path uses `utils.get_logger`. The web path uses `app.logger` (the Flask logger). Logging changes touch both consistently or land in neither — partial migrations leave the two paths emitting different formats and break log consumers downstream.

4. **`param_definitions.json` is a structured surface.** Additive changes only. Renaming a key, removing one, or changing its type contract breaks the configuration UI and any external tooling that reads the schema. New entries are fine; mutations need a migration plan and a maintainer-led review.
