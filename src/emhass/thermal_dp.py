"""Dynamic-programming solver for a heat-pump-charged thermal store.

A heat pump's COP depends on the temperature it charges the store to
(``COP = carnot * T_supply_K / (T_supply - T_outdoor)``), and the delivered heat is
``P_elec * COP(T_store)`` - a bilinear, non-convex coupling that a single MILP cannot
solve exactly. Dynamic programming sidesteps it: the state is the store
temperature(s); backward induction evaluates the true COP at every state and returns
the globally-optimal dispatch in a single pass, with no convexity assumption and no
linearisation.

The store may optionally be coupled to a second store it feeds through a temperature
gradient (e.g. a tank that supplies a larger sink), which adds a second state and is
still tractable on a day-ahead horizon. Costs are evaluated against a per-timestep
electricity price for the heat pump and a commodity price for an optional backup
source (gas/oil/electric element).

The model is intentionally generic - one heat-pump store, an optional coupled store,
an optional backup source - so it applies to any such configuration. Parameters carry
neutral defaults; callers supply the values for the store they are solving.
