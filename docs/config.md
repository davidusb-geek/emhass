# Configuration file

In this section we will explain all the parts of the `config_emhass.yaml` needed to properly run EMHASS.

We will find three main parts on the configuration file:

- The parameters needed to retrieve data from Home Assistant (retrieve_hass_conf)
- The parameters to define the optimization problem (optim_conf)
- The parameters used to model the system (plant_conf)

## Retrieve HASS data configuration

These are the parameters that we will need to define to retrieve data from Home Assistant. There are no optional parameters. In the case of a list, an empty list is a valid entry.

- freq: The time step to resample retrieved data from hass. This parameter is given in minutes. It should not be defined too low or you will run into memory problems when defining the Linear Programming optimization. Defaults to 30. 
- days_to_retrieve: We will retrieve data from now and up to days_to_retrieve days. Defaults to 2.
- var_PV: This is the name of the photovoltaic produced power sensor in Watts from Home Assistant. For example: 'sensor.power_photovoltaics'.
- var_load: The name of the household power consumption sensor in Watts from Home Assistant. The deferrable loads that we will want to include in the optimization problem should be substracted from this sensor in HASS. For example: 'sensor.power_load_no_var_loads'
- load_negative: Set this parameter to True if the retrived load variable is negative by convention. Defaults to False.
- set_zero_min: Set this parameter to True to give a special treatment for a minimum value saturation to zero for power consumption data. Values below zero are replaced by nans. Defaults to True.
- var_replace_zero: The list of retrieved variables that we would want to replace nans (if they exist) with zeros. For example:
	- 'sensor.power_photovoltaics'
- var_interp: The list of retrieved variables that we would want to interpolate nans values using linear interpolation. For example:
	- 'sensor.power_photovoltaics'
	- 'sensor.power_load_no_var_loads'
- method_ts_round: Set the method for timestamp rounding, options are: first, last and nearest.

A second part of this section is given by some privacy-sensitive parameters that should be included in a `secrets_emhass.yaml` file alongside the `config_emhass.yaml` file.

The parameters in the `secrets_emhass.yaml` file are:

- hass_url: The URL to your Home Assistant instance. For example: https://myhass.duckdns.org/
- long_lived_token: A Long-Lived Access Token from the Lovelace profile page.
- time_zone: The time zone of your system. For example: Europe/Paris.
- lat: The latitude. For example: 45.0.
- lon: The longitude. For example: 6.0
- alt: The altitude in meters. For example: 100.0

## Optimization configuration parameters

These are the parameters needed to properly define the optimization problem.

- set_use_battery: Set to True if we should consider an energy storage device such as a Li-Ion battery. Defaults to False.
- delta_forecast: The number of days for forecasted data. Defaults to 1.
- num_def_loads: Define the number of deferrable loads to consider. Defaults to 2.
- P_deferrable_nom: The nominal power for each deferrable load in Watts. This is a list with a number of elements consistent with the number of deferrable loads defined before. For example:
	- 3000
	- 750
- def_total_hours: The total number of hours that each deferrable load should operate. For example:
	- 5
	- 8
- treat_def_as_semi_cont: Define if we should treat each deferrable load as a semi-continuous variable. Semi-continuous variables are variables that must take a value between their minimum and maximum or zero. For example:
	- True
	- True
- set_def_constant: Define if we should set each deferrable load as a constant fixed value variable with just one startup for each optimization task. For example:
	- False
	- False
- weather_forecast_method: This will define the weather forecast method that will be used. The options are 'scraper' for a scraping method for weather forecast from clearoutside.com and 'csv' to load a CSV file. When loading a CSV file this will be directly considered as the PV power forecast in Watts. The default CSV file path that will be used is '/data/data_weather_forecast.csv'. Defaults to 'scraper' method.
- load_forecast_method: The load forecast method that will be used. The options are 'csv' to load a CSV file or 'naive' for a simple 1-day persistance model. The default CSV file path that will be used is '/data/data_load_forecast.csv'. Defaults to 'naive'.
- load_cost_forecast_method: Define the method that will be used for load cost forecast. The options are 'hp_hc_periods' for peak and non-peak hours contracts and 'csv' to load custom cost from CSV file. The default CSV file path that will be used is '/data/data_load_cost_forecast.csv'.
The following parameters and definitions are only needed if load_cost_forecast_method='hp_hc_periods':
- hp_periods: Define a list of peak hour periods for load consumption from the grid. This is useful if you have a contract with peak and non-peak hours. For example for two peak hour periods: 
	- start: '02:54'
	  end: '15:24'
	- start: '17:24'
	  end: '20:24'
	load_cost_hp: The cost of the electrical energy from the grid during peak hours in €/kWh. Defaults to 0.1907.
	load_cost_hc: The cost of the electrical energy from the grid during non-peak hours in €/kWh. Defaults to 0.1419.

- prod_price_forecast_method: Define the method that will be used for PV power production price forecast. This is the price that is payed by the utility for energy injected to the grid. The options are 'constant' for a constant fixed value or 'csv' to load custom price forecast from a CSV file. The default CSV file path that will be used is '/data/data_prod_price_forecast.csv'.
- prod_sell_price: The paid price for energy injected to the grid from excedent PV production in €/kWh. Defaults to 0.065. This parameter is only needed if prod_price_forecast_method='constant'.
- set_total_pv_sell: Set this parameter to true to consider that all the PV power produced is injected to the grid. No direct self-consumption. The default is false, for as system with direct self-consumption.
- lp_solver: Set the name of the linear programming solver that will be used. Defaults to 'COIN_CMD'. The options are 'PULP_CBC_CMD', 'GLPK_CMD' and 'COIN_CMD'. 
- lp_solver_path: Set the path to the LP solver. Defaults to '/usr/bin/cbc'. 
- set_nocharge_from_grid: Set this to true if you want to forbidden to charge the battery from the grid. The battery will only be charged from excess PV.

## System configuration parameters

These are the technical parameters of the energy system of the household.

- P_grid_max: The maximum power that can be supplied by the utility grid in Watts. Defaults to 9000.

We will define the technical parameters of the PV installation. For the modeling task we rely on the PVLib Python package. For more information see: [https://pvlib-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/](https://pvlib-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
The complete list of supported modules can be found here: [https://github.com/davidusb-geek/emhass-add-on/files/9234460/sam-library-cec-modules-2019-03-05.csv](https://github.com/davidusb-geek/emhass-add-on/files/9234460/sam-library-cec-modules-2019-03-05.csv) 
And the list of inverter models can be found here: [https://github.com/davidusb-geek/emhass-add-on/files/9532724/sam-library-cec-inverters-2019-03-05.csv](https://github.com/davidusb-geek/emhass-add-on/files/9532724/sam-library-cec-inverters-2019-03-05.csv)
If your specific model is not found in these lists then solution (1) is to pick another model as close as possible as yours in terms of the nominal power.
Solution (2) would be to use SolCast and pass that data directly to emhass as a list of values from a template. Take a look at this example here: [https://emhass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/forecasts.html#example-using-solcast-forecast-amber-prices](https://emhass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/forecasts.html#example-using-solcast-forecast-amber-prices)

This parameter can be a list of items to enable the simulation of mixed orientation systems, for example one east-facing array (azimuth=90) and one west-facing array (azimuth=270). When finding the correct model for your installation remember to replace all the special characters in the model name by '_'.
