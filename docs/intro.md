# Introduction

EMHASS (Energy Management for Home Assistant) is an optimization tool designed for residential households. The package uses a Linear Programming approach to optimize energy usage while considering factors such as electricity prices, power generation from solar panels, and energy storage from batteries. EMHASS provides a high degree of configurability, making it easy to integrate with Home Assistant and other smart home systems. Whether you have solar panels, energy storage, or just a controllable load, EMHASS can provide an optimized daily schedule for your devices, allowing you to save money and minimize your environmental impact.

## What is Energy Management for Home Assistant (EMHASS)?

EMHASS and Home Assistant provide a comprehensive energy management solution that can optimize energy usage and reduce costs for households. By integrating these two systems, households can take advantage of advanced energy management features that provide significant cost savings, increased energy efficiency, and greater sustainability.

EMHASS is a powerful energy management tool that generates an optimization plan based on variables such as solar power production, energy usage, and energy costs. The plan provides valuable insights into how energy can be better managed and utilized in the household. Even if households do not have all the necessary equipment, such as solar panels or batteries, EMHASS can still provide a minimal use case solution to optimize energy usage for controllable/deferrable loads.

Home Assistant provides a platform for the automation of household devices based on the optimization plan generated by EMHASS. This includes devices such as batteries, pool pumps, hot water heaters, and electric vehicle (EV) chargers. By automating EV charging and other devices, households can take advantage of off-peak energy rates and optimize their EV charging schedule based on the optimization plan generated by EMHASS.

One of the main benefits of integrating EMHASS and Home Assistant is the ability to customize and tailor the energy management solution to the specific needs and preferences of each household. With EMHASS, households can define their energy management objectives and constraints, such as maximizing self-consumption or minimizing energy costs, and the system will generate an optimization plan accordingly. Home Assistant provides a platform for the automation of devices based on the optimization plan, allowing households to create a fully customized and optimized energy management solution.

Overall, the integration of EMHASS and Home Assistant offers a comprehensive energy management solution that provides significant cost savings, increased energy efficiency, and greater sustainability for households. By leveraging advanced energy management features and automation capabilities, households can achieve their energy management objectives while enjoying the benefits of more efficient and sustainable energy usage, including optimized EV charging schedules.
