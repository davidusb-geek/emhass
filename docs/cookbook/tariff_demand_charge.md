# Demand / capacity charge on peak grid import

## Goal

Price a tariff's billed demand peak inside the same EMHASS optimization that prices energy. EMHASS remains tariff-agnostic: the caller supplies the rate, billing-period incumbent, demand window and (for rolling MPC) any realised part of the open tariff interval.

## Prerequisites

- Base capacity charging (`capacity_cost_per_kw` and `current_period_peak`) is available from EMHASS 0.17.7.
- Demand-window use requires a build exposing `capacity_charge_window`.
- Tariff-interval aggregation requires a build exposing `capacity_charge_interval_timesteps` and `capacity_charge_current_interval_history`.
- Transport: examples below are direct EMHASS config/runtime payloads. Adapter-specific Node-RED, Home Assistant and AppDaemon transport is not claimed as tested here.

## Step 1: Set the marginal capacity-charge rate

<!-- source: src/emhass/data/config_defaults.json:140 -->
<!-- source: src/emhass/data/associations.csv:99 -->
<!-- transport: direct EMHASS configuration; adapter-specific transport untested -->

Set `capacity_cost_per_kw` to the marginal billing cost of increasing the applicable billed peak by 1 kW. Do not blindly copy a daily tariff number unless the tariff applies one billing-period peak across those billable days; if it does, convert the daily rate to the corresponding billing-period marginal cost.

```yaml
optim_conf:
  capacity_cost_per_kw: 8.0
```

`0` (default) disables capacity charging.

Expected: the optimization still solves normally; a positive rate gives the solver an economic reason to reduce the applicable demand peak when flexibility is available.

## Step 2: Understand the default N=1 model

<!-- source: src/emhass/optimization.py:1882 -->
<!-- source: src/emhass/optimization.py:1897 -->
<!-- source: src/emhass/optimization.py:2174 -->

At the default `capacity_charge_interval_timesteps = 1`, `peak_import` is constrained by each eligible positive-import timestep and floored by `current_period_peak`. The objective prices that scalar peak once in currency/kW.

```text
peak_import >= capacity_charge_window[t] * p_grid_pos[t]
peak_import >= current_period_peak

capacity term = capacity_cost_per_kw * peak_import / 1000
```

This is a power charge, so it is not multiplied by the optimization timestep.

Expected: `N=1` preserves the pre-aggregation capacity-charge semantics.

## Step 3: Feed the incumbent billing-period peak (MPC)

<!-- source: src/emhass/utils.py:1771 -->
<!-- transport: direct EMHASS naive-mpc-optim runtime JSON; adapter-specific transport untested -->

Pass `current_period_peak` in Watts. With `N=1`, use the highest eligible positive-import timestep already incurred in the current billing period. With `N>1`, use the highest eligible completed tariff-interval average instead.

```json
{
  "prediction_horizon": 24,
  "capacity_cost_per_kw": 8.0,
  "current_period_peak": 6000
}
```

The currently open tariff interval is not part of this incumbent until it completes.

Expected: EMHASS does not spend flexibility trying to reduce the planned peak below a billed peak that is already locked in.

## Step 3b: Apply the tariff demand window (MPC)

<!-- source: src/emhass/utils.py:1780 -->
<!-- transport: direct EMHASS naive-mpc-optim runtime JSON; adapter-specific transport untested -->

`capacity_charge_window` is a `prediction_horizon`-length list aligned with the horizon. The example below has `prediction_horizon: 24`, so the mask contains exactly 24 values.

```json
{
  "prediction_horizon": 24,
  "capacity_cost_per_kw": 8.0,
  "current_period_peak": 6000,
  "capacity_charge_window": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
}
```

The caller owns business-day, holiday, season and timezone rules. With `N>1`, EMHASS uses the mask value at each completed tariff interval endpoint, so demand-window boundaries should align with tariff measurement-interval boundaries.

Expected: only eligible demand-window timesteps/intervals can raise the priced peak.

## Step 3c: Price a tariff measurement interval

<!-- source: src/emhass/data/config_defaults.json:141 -->
<!-- source: src/emhass/data/associations.csv:100 -->
<!-- source: src/emhass/optimization.py:1665 -->
<!-- source: src/emhass/utils.py:1788 -->
<!-- transport: direct EMHASS configuration/runtime JSON; adapter-specific transport untested -->

Set `capacity_charge_interval_timesteps` to the number of native optimization timesteps in one tariff measurement interval:

```yaml
optim_conf:
  capacity_charge_interval_timesteps: 6
```

For a 5-minute optimizer and a clocked 30-minute demand interval, `N=6`. `N` must be a positive integer; invalid values warn and fall back to `1`. A ratio such as 30/20 = 1.5 cannot be represented exactly by this model.

With `N>1`, EMHASS prices completed N-timestep average positive import instead of the largest raw native timestep. A single 6000 W 5-minute spike in an otherwise-zero 30-minute block therefore contributes 1000 W to the billed 30-minute average.

Rolling MPC may start inside an already-open interval. Pass the average positive-import power for each elapsed native timestep, oldest to newest:

```json
{
  "prediction_horizon": 24,
  "capacity_cost_per_kw": 8.0,
  "capacity_charge_interval_timesteps": 6,
  "capacity_charge_current_interval_history": [2000, 4000, 0, 6000]
}
```

At 17:20 in a 17:00-17:30 interval, four 5-minute averages are already realised. If the remaining planned averages are 3000 W and 1000 W, the completed 30-minute average is `(2000 + 4000 + 0 + 6000 + 3000 + 1000) / 6 = 2666.7 W`.

History entries are native-interval averages, not instantaneous snapshots. An equivalent energy measurement is valid after conversion to mean Watts.

Expected: the first tariff interval combines realised history with the remaining planned timesteps, then subsequent completed intervals use planned data only.

## Step 4: Verify the tariff metric

<!-- source: src/emhass/optimization.py:1665 -->
<!-- transport: local Python helper; untested adapter transport - contribution welcome -->

Do not verify `N>1` with the raw maximum of `P_grid`; that would compare a native-timestep peak with a tariff-interval average. Use the same completed-interval metric:

```python
def billed_peak_w(p_grid_w, n=1, history=(), window=None, incumbent_w=0):
    imports = [max(float(p), 0.0) for p in p_grid_w]
    weights = [1.0] * len(imports) if window is None else list(window)
    if n == 1:
        candidates = [w * p for w, p in zip(weights, imports)]
    else:
        m = len(history)
        end = n - m - 1
        candidates = []
        first = True
        while end < len(imports):
            if first:
                total = sum(history) + sum(imports[: end + 1])
                first = False
            else:
                total = sum(imports[end - n + 1 : end + 1])
            candidates.append(weights[end] * total / n)
            end += n
    return max([float(incumbent_w), *candidates])

assert billed_peak_w([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6000], n=6) == 1000
assert round(billed_peak_w([3000, 1000], n=6, history=[2000, 4000, 0, 6000]), 1) == 2666.7
```

Expected: comparisons between capacity-charge runs use the billed metric above, not the raw native-timestep maximum.

## Caveats

- `current_period_peak`, `capacity_charge_window` and `capacity_charge_current_interval_history` are MPC runtime inputs. The structural `capacity_charge_interval_timesteps` applies to the shared capacity-charge model.
- `dayahead-optim` and `perfect-optim` have no elapsed-interval history. With `N>1`, start their horizon on a tariff measurement-interval boundary.
- A tariff interval incomplete at the far end of the horizon is not priced until a later receding-horizon solve can see its completion. No terminal continuation model is added here.
- Exact billing-period rollover with `N>1` assumes the billing-period boundary aligns with a tariff measurement-interval boundary. EMHASS does not split one aggregated interval across two billing periods.
- This implementation represents one capacity-charge component per solve. Independent components with different rates, windows or incumbent peaks require separate future support.
- `current_period_peak` and interval history are in Watts; `capacity_cost_per_kw` is currency/kW.
- The caller owns tariff calendar/state. EMHASS does not persist billing-period peaks or compute tariff seasons/timezones.
